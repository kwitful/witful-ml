    "The main goal of most machine learning models is to carry out predictions based on data. In real implementations, ML models are expected work with data which is completely new to them. They are trained with a certain amount of data, but make their predictions based on completely new data. Actually we have two options and this presents a dilemma:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We train/fit the model with the data we have. The model adjusts its algorithm accordingly and it fine-tunes everything for that dataset. This makes the model super efficient on that particular dataset but makes it unreliable when it is used on new data. This is beacause the model has 'learned' everything on a single dataset. It fails to function when it meets the different patterns in the new data (This is called 'Overfitting')\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We train/fit the model with very little data to avoid this overfitting issue. This will also make the model inefficient as it won't have access to the amount it needs to adjust its algorithm. (This is called 'Underfitting')\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that our models learn enough and perform well on new data, we must set a balance between how they are trained on existing data and how they are tested with new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait! How can we do this if we have no new data? How can we produce new data when all we have is a single dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "Train_test split is here to help! It splits our data set, trains the model with a part of it and reserves the rest, never showing it to our model. This way, it helps us see how our model would perform on brand new data. \n",
